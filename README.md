# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction (CodeAlpha Internship Task 3)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts car resale prices using machine learning.  
We trained a Linear Regression model on car features like Year, Present Price, and Driven Kms.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Š Results
- RÂ² Score: (your score here)
- RMSE: (your value here)

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- Newer cars (higher Year) sell for higher prices.
- Higher Present Price increases resale value.
- Cars with higher mileage have lower resale price.

## ðŸ”— Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Example Visualizations
