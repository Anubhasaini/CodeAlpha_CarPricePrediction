# CodeAlpha_CarPricePrediction
This project is part of my Data Science Internship with CodeAlpha, where I worked on building a Car Price Prediction model using Python and Machine Learning. The main objective of this project is to predict the resale value of cars based on various features such as Year of Manufacture, Present Price, and Driven Kilometers.
